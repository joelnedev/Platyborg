## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you find a vulnerability within the bot, you **must** contact me at any of the emails associated with my commits or DM me on Discord (@JuhJuhButt#7818). I'll credit you for discovery, and depending on the severety, I might reward you too.

## Exploiting Vulnerabilites

Exploiting the bot in any way is forbidden. Whether it's in good spirits or not, you will be punished accordingly for taking destructive actions against me, the bot, my host server, the Discord server, and/or other users.

Furthermore, punishment will also occur if you find a vulnerability and fail to report it.
