## How to Contribute

Any help with developing the bot is greatly appreciated. *You don't have to learn programming to help around,* small things like providing suggestions, commenting on issues/pull requests, etc. are also ways to contribute.

### Basics

As noted above, you can contribute to the bot by
- Commenting on issues/pull requests
- Creating issues or starting discussions
- Emailing me

### Programming

> If you're looking through the code, disregard any files in the `dist/` directory. Those are compilations of the TypeScript files, and generally aren't meant to be read by humans. 

If you know JavaScript/TypeScript or want to learn it, discord.js is a great place to start (it's where I did). Some helpful resources include [the official guide](https://discordjs.guide) and [An Idiot's Guide](https://anidiots.guide). For more technical stuff, the documentation can be found [here](https://discord.js.org). If you're a beginner in JavaScript, Evie, the creator of Enmap/JOSH and co-author of An Idiot's Guide, has an [*awesome* quickstart guide](https://js.evie.dev).

Even if you've just started with d.js, you can still look at my code and learn from there, point out mistakes, make suggestions, and ask questions. To directly make a suggestion to edit code, you can [make a pull request](https://github.com/joelnedev/Platyborg/pulls/new) (the way this works is: you fork the repo, edit that fork, then request to merge those changes into the main repo).
